# Moonlight-Solar-Farm-Data-Analysis Dashboard

The **Moonlight-Solar-Farm-Data-Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive and user-friendly tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into solar farm data. This dashboard leverages powerful data visualization techniques to analyze and interpret solar irradiation data, with a particular focus on identifying regions with high potential for solar energy farming.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Upload:** Upload three CSV files corresponding to datasets from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Perform detailed analysis and visualization of solar irradiation data for each country.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design, making it easy to navigate and interpret the data.

## How to Use

1. **Upload the CSV Files:**

   - The dashboard requires three CSV files, one for each of the following countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
   - The order in which you upload the files is critical, as the dashboard reads them in the following sequence:
     1. **Benin's dataset**
     2. **Sierra Leone's dataset**
     3. **Togo's dataset**
   - Only three CSV files are allowed. If more or fewer files are uploaded, the analysis won't proceed.

2. **Explore the Dashboard:**
   - Once the files are uploaded, the dashboard will automatically process the data and display various analyses and visualizations.
   - Use the navigation options to explore different aspects of the data, compare countries, and gain insights into the potential for solar energy farming.
