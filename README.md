# MoonLight Energy Solutions Solar Energy Potential Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comparative analysis of solar energy potential in Benin, Togo, and Sierra Leone. The analysis focuses on various metrics such as irradiation types, wind speed, and direction to determine the best location for investing in solar energy infrastructure.

## Methodology

The analysis involves:

- Cleaning and preparing the data by removing irrelevant columns, clipping negative readings, and handling outliers.
- Decomposing timestamps into 'Hour' and 'Month' for detailed temporal analysis.
- Comparing solar panel efficiency and irradiation measurements across the three countries.
- Assessing wind speed and direction to evaluate their impact on solar panel performance.

## Tools Used

| Tool    | Purpose                     |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| DVC     | For handling data           |
| Pandas  | For data analysis           |
| Seaborn | For visualization           |
| Numpy   | For numerical operations    |
| Scipy   | For scientific computations |

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, Benin is recommended as the optimal location for solar energy investment due to its higher irradiation levels and favorable wind conditions.
